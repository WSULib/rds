	<h1>Copyright Guidelines for Posting Documents to Blackboard</h1>
</div>
<div class="container tab-content">
	<img src="inc/img/blackboard.png" alt="" class="bb">
	<p>Documents are no longer copyright protected, and therefore can be freely used, if:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Published prior to 1923</li>
		<li>Published between 1923 and 1963 without a copyright notice</li>
		<li>Published between 1923 and 1963 with copyright notice on work and not renewed with the U.S. Copyright Office
			<ul>
				<li>Note: The lack of online documentation with the U.S. Copyright Office does not mean the copyright was not renewed</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Fair Use provisions and the Teach Act (2002) enables certain educational uses such as Blackboard posting, providing:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Limited portions of the work are made available at any one time</li>
		<li>Use must be part of mediated instructional activities</li>
		<li>Availability must take place during a period of time relevant to the context and duration of a typical class session</li>
		<li>Use must be limited to students enrolled in the course
			<ul>
				<li>Do not share work or distribute via email</li>
				<li>Ensure the Blackboard site is password protected</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>No posting of textbook materials typically purchased or acquired by students is allowed or considered fair use</li>
		<li>No posting of protected materials developed specifically for online use</li>
		<li>No use of copies are allowed that are not directly captured from the licensed original</li>
	</ul>
	<p>We recommend:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Locate resources to use for coursework through full-text resources owned by the library system and link to them from Blackboard</li>
		<li>Hyperlink to those resources from your digital syllabus</li>
		<li>Reconsider the need to digitize a print resource and find a licensed full-text alternative</li>
		<li>If you need to copy a resource:
			<ul>
				<li>Perform a fair use analysis, see: <a href="checklist.php">Fair Use Checklist</a></li>
				<li>If deemed fair use, make a digital scan of a reasonable portion of the original</li>
				<li><a href="inc/Copyright_Notice.pdf" target="_blank">Ensure a copyright notice is on the digital copy</a>
					<ul>
						<li>The University Libraries will assist obtaining content if a request for a digital copy is placed</li>
						<li>You can only post documents obtained through a delivery system if you or the library system has purchased the licensed original (meaning it is owned and the copy comes from the owned copy)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>All works not considered fair use require copyright permission. Obtaining copyright permission is the responsibility of the instructor posting on Blackboard.</p>
	<p>We recommend:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Get permission from the rights-holder
			<ul>
				<li><a href="http://www.copyright.com" target="_blank">www.copyright.com</a> is the interface to seeking copyright permission</li>
			</ul>
